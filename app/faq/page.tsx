        <Question title="Do I have to contribute data to access the public dataset?">
          No! The public dataset is available to everyone so we can collectively

          efforts.

        <Question title="How can I get and set up a monitoring station?">
          The Platform is device-agnostic. You can buy and set up any type of
          camera, then log on to the Platform to upload and process your images.
